# In-process ConPTY

## tl;dr

**Why?**
* Out-of-process leads to out-of-sync issues.
* Not all Console APIs have a VT equivalent.
* Time consuming maintenance work due to poor encapsulation inside conhost.

**How?**
1. Remove `VtEngine` and translate Console API calls directly to VT.
2. Move all Console API related code from the `Host` to the `Server` project.
   Narrow the `IApiRoutines` interface down to its essentials.
   Replace relevant singletons with instances.
3. Make `Server` a standalone library with `IApiRoutines` as its primary callback interface.
   Integrate the library in Windows Terminal.
4. Ship the `Server` library as part of Windows. Build conhost itself on top of it.
   (Long term goal.)

To extend on the [tl;dr](#tldr):
* ConPTY runs out-of-process, outside the hosting terminal, which leads to an unsolvable issue: The buffer contents between ConPTY and the terminal can go out of sync.
  * The terminal and ConPTY may implement escape sequences differently.
  * ...may implement text processing differently.
  * ...may implement text reflow (resize) differently.
  * Resizing the terminal and ConPTY is asynchronous and there may be concurrent text output.
  * ...and it may uncover text from the scrollback, which ConPTY doesn't know about.
* Since ConPTY communicates with the hosting terminal exclusively via escape sequences, it fails to cover some Console API methods that cannot be represented via VT sequences. The most basic example of this is the lack of LVB gridlines.
* As the prototype that ConPTY initially was it has fulfilled our needs a thousand times over, but it being just a layer on top of conhost has resulted in software decay. Today, ConPTY's architecture is difficult to maintain and debug. The layer boundary with existing conhost code has slowly blurred over the years which has negatively affected many places. Lastly, its performance is poor and subject to much debate. It's on us now to finally pay our debt and make ConPTY its own proper, composable component that both conhost and Windows Terminal can be built on top of.

Considerations:
* A named `MUTEX` can theoretically be used to solve parts of the out-of-sync issue, because it could be used to ensure a synchronous buffer reflow.
  However, this requires the shared lock to be acquired every time input is processed, on top of the regular console lock, which raises ABBA deadlock concerns, in particular since it requires cross-process communication while the lock is held.
  Making this setup not just hopefully but also provably robust, is likely to be very difficult.
  It also doesn't solve any of the other listed problems.
  Running ConPTY in-process on the other hand appears to be a trivial change in comparison.

## Step 1: Remove VtEngine

    linkStyle 2,3,4,5,6,7,9,11 opacity:0.2
    style VtEngine opacity:0.2
```

### Steps

* Remove VtEngine
* Remove `--vtmode`
* Remove `--resizeQuirk`
* Add buffering to `VtIo` and hook it up to the output pipe
* Implement direct VT translations for all relevant Console APIs

### Discussion

The idea is that we can translate Console API calls directly to VT at least as well as the current VtEngine setup can. For instance, a call to `SetConsoleCursorPosition` clearly translates directly to a `CUP` escape sequence. But even complex calls like `WriteConsoleOutputAttribute` which have no VT equivalent can be implemented this way by first applying the changes to our local text buffer and then serializing the affected range back to VT. Since the Console API is extremely limited (only 16 colors, etc.), the serialization code will similarly be extremely simple. That's also how VtEngine currently works, but instead of doing it asynchronously in the renderer thread, we'll do it synchronously right during the Console API call.

The `--vtmode xterm-ascii` switch exists for the telnet client as it only supports ASCII as per RFC854 section "THE NVT PRINTER AND KEYBOARD". However, telnet is the only user of this flag and it's trivial to do there (for instance by stripping high codepoints in `WriteOutputToClient` in `telnet/console.cpp`), so there's no reason for us to keep this logic in the new code.

This change will result in a significant reduction in complexity of our architecture. VT input from the shell or other clients will be given 1:1 to the hosting terminal, which will once and for all resolve our ordering and buffering issues.

## Step 2: Move Console API implementations to Server

    style ConPTY opacity:0.2
    style VtIo opacity:0.2
    style ConPTY_output opacity:0.2
```

### Steps

* Move the API implementation from the `Host` to the `Server` project.
* Narrow down the `IApiRoutines` interface to its essentials.
* Replace affected singletons with regular class instances.

### Discussion

This step is somewhat difficult to visualize, but the basic idea is that instead of having 3 arrows going in and out of the Server component, we got exactly 1. This makes the console server and its VT translation a proper, reusable component, which we need so that we can solve the out-of-sync issues and to support all Console APIs. To make the Server API convenient to use, the interface needs to be narrowed down to as few methods as possible. This interface is currently called `IApiRoutines`.

### API Design

```cs
// The Console API is built around a freely addressable frame buffer. It allows you to
// address any part of the buffer, even those outside of what's considered the "viewport".
// Consequentially, ConPTY supports this and `CONPTY_COORD` instances are relative to the Console Buffer:
//
//                       ┌──────────────────┐    ╮
//                       │y=-3              │    │
//                       │                  │    │
//                       │                  │    │
//                    ╭  ├──────────────────┤    ├── VT scrollback
//                    │  │y=0               │    │
//                    │  │                  │    │
//                    │  │                  │    │
//   Console Buffer ──┤  ├──────────────────┤  ╮ ╯

//                    ╰  └──────────────────┘  ╯
//
// The good news is that nothing prevents you from giving the Console Buffer the exact
// same size as the VT Viewport and for modern terminals doing so is recommended.
// That way, `CONPTY_COORD` instances are all viewport-relative:
//

// Coordinates are 0-indexed. Note that while INT32 coordinates are used by this API, coordinates below
// 0 and above 65535 are generally invalid, as the Console ABI currently uses unsigned 16-Bit integers.
//
// You should still always perform input validation and return E_INVALIDARG for invalid coordinates.
struct CONPTY_COORD {
    INT32 x;
    INT32 y;
};

// These flags are also defined via Windows.h.
#if 0
// These flags are equivalent to the classic 4-bit indexed colors in VT via SGR.
// However, the order of blue and red bits are swapped. You can use the following C code to switch back and forth between
#define FOREGROUND_BLUE            0x0001 // Text color contains blue.
#define FOREGROUND_GREEN           0x0002 // Text color contains green.
#define FOREGROUND_RED             0x0004 // Text color contains red.
#define FOREGROUND_INTENSITY       0x0008 // Text color is intensified.
#define BACKGROUND_BLUE            0x0010 // Background color contains blue.
#define BACKGROUND_GREEN           0x0020 // Background color contains green.
#define BACKGROUND_RED             0x0040 // Background color contains red.
#define BACKGROUND_INTENSITY       0x0080 // Background color is intensified.

// These two bits are used to represent wide glyphs.
#define COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE    0x0100 // Leading byte.
#define COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE   0x0200 // Trailing byte.

// This bit is equivalent to the "CSI 7 m" reverse video escape sequence.
#define COMMON_LVB_REVERSE_VIDEO   0x4000 // Reverse foreground and background attribute.

// NOTE: These flags have no equivalent in VT. COMMON_LVB_UNDERSCORE in particular is not the same as a
// "CSI 4 m" underline in VT, despite the name. They're used to give a cell border (= grid) lines.
#define COMMON_LVB_GRID_HORIZONTAL 0x0400 // Top horizontal.
#define COMMON_LVB_GRID_LVERTICAL  0x0800 // Left vertical.
#define COMMON_LVB_GRID_RVERTICAL  0x1000 // Right vertical.
#define COMMON_LVB_UNDERSCORE      0x8000 // Underscore.
#endif

// This struct is binary compatible to the CHAR_INFO struct from the Windows API and functionally equivalent.
//
// The following rules MUST be followed:
// * Each instance represents 1 cell in the terminal.
// * Each instance contains a single UCS-2 character.
//   Surrogate pairs and grapheme clusters are not allowed. Replace them with U+FFFD.
// * Colors that cannot be represented via the `attributes` flags can be replaced with an approximation.
//   Alternatively, `FOREGROUND_BLUE | FOREGROUND_GREEN | FOREGROUND_RED` can be used (no `BACKGROUND` bit set).
// * If a wide glyph (2 cells wide) is encountered, the following applies:
//   * Create 2 consecutive CONPTY_CHAR_INFO instances (as per the first rule).
//   * Repeat the same `character` in both instances, even if it's U+FFFD.
//   * Assign the first instance an `attributes` flag of `COMMON_LVB_LEADING_BYTE`
//     and the second one `COMMON_LVB_TRAILING_BYTE`.
//   * BUT if the request for a CONPTY_CHAR_INFO only partially intersects a wide glyph, replace the character
//     (and only the character) with U+0020 whitespace. This also means that `COMMON_LVB_LEADING/TRAILING_BYTE`
//     should not be set, because the returned character isn't wide anymore. An example:
//     If you have a red "猫" on top of a blue background in the buffer and a single `CONPTY_CHAR_INFO` is requested
//     for the left half of the glyph, then you should set `character` to whitespace and `attributes` to
//     `FOREGROUND_RED | BACKGROUND_BLUE`. Debug builds of ConPTY will assert that you do this.
//
// For more documentation about the `attributes` flags, see the constants defined above.

// First of all: You don't need to implement all functions and all structs perfectly for ConPTY to work decently well.
// For instance, if you don't implement `CONPTY_INFO::cursorHeight` properly, barely anything will happen.
//
// If you start implementing this interface, consider ignoring most `Set*()` calls, return sensible defaults in the `Get*()` and `Read*()` calls,

    // The following methods are the most important parts of this interface and should be implemented first.
    //

    // The console server is single-threaded and no two calls will be made simultaneously. These two functions

    //
    // Lock() will always be called before any of the functions below are called.
    // Lock() and Unlock() do not need to support recursive locking.

    // You don't need to keep the CONPTY_INFO struct constantly up to date, but you're allowed to.
    //   For instance, it's valid to change the CONPTY_COORD::cursorPosition field when SetCursorPosition() is called.
    //   But changing the CONPTY_INFO struct concurrently is not permitted. The previous call to Lock() is expected to lock the terminal.
